# üóì Last Hope 

The Last Hope project consists of the creation of a web application, allowing a company to modulate projects by creating tasks like Trello for example.
The site also allows visualization in the form of a graph as well as the sharing of comments and files within projects.

# üåü Languages that we used

We used React library on the front side and added Redux Toolkit.
On the back side we used Express and Apollo Server to expose a GraphQL API to power the front side.
